              <p>The second plot is a line plot, providing the number of Games (G), Points scored (PTS) and True Shooting Percentage (TS) for every MVP player for 60 years of the league.</p> 
              <p>See how these scores defined their legacy, how they stack up against each other, and how each of them claimed a place in basketball history.</p>
